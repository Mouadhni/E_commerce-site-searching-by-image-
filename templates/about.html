        <p>
            It's an e-commerce web application that allows users to search for products by uploading an image. Here
            are the key features:
        </p>
        <h3>Primary Objective</h3>
        <p>
            The main goal is to create a dynamic web page that enables customers to search for products by presenting
            an image of the product.
        </p>
        <h3>Expected Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Interface for Image Upload: Users can upload an image of the product.</li>
            <li>Product Display: Initial display of a random set of images representing different products.</li>
            <li>Product Search: When an image is selected, display a list of similar products corresponding to that
                image.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Required Technologies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML5, CSS (Bootstrap) for web page design and style.</li>
            <li>Python for backend development.</li>
            <li>Pre-trained Image Classification Model on ImageNet to find similar products based on user-submitted
                images.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Backend Development</h3>
        <p>
            Backend development involves using Python to handle the user-submitted image and provide a list of similar
            products based on a pre-trained image classification model.
        </p>
        <h3>Model Training</h3>
        <p>
            We'll utilize pre-trained image classification models, such as those available on Keras, trained on the
            ImageNet database, to classify images and find similar products.
        </p>

            Our main objective is to create a user-friendly interface that allows customers to search for products by
            uploading an image, utilizing a pre-trained model to classify images and provide a list of similar
            products.
